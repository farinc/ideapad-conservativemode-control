# ideapad-conservativemode-control
A super simple tray indicator to control the conservative mode that is common among ideapads. Made using the AppIndicator3.0 library and writen in python, it adds a tray to desktops that support the indicator plugin system. It uses the ideapad-acpi module so it should be compatible with most (if not all) ideapads.
